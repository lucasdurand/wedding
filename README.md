# La Boda

This is the wedding site 💍 for 🇲🇽 Bety + Lucas 🇨🇦

## Deployment

We are set up for continuous deployment with netlify: https://app.netlify.com/sites/betyandlucas/overview. Merge to the `main` branch and it will kick off a "build" and serve the site. Currently we're configured just to serve the static html. **Don't get carried away and think we need more than that!** 

## Development

* It's all an HTML file!
* Actually now it's **2** html files and an `.svg`
* One day maybe a `.css`???
